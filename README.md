# convertify.IO
A typical Spreadsheet To Template Converter that can be used to auto generate repeatable HTML pages using a given template.
It converts XLS or XLSX files to an HTML template provided in a path.
# How to use it ?
Ideal way would be to export as a runnable JAR File, and execute the command with the following arguments to the jar file :-
	 First Argument = Path of the Excel Sheet
	 Second Argument = Destination Directory of the Converter

# What is the structure of the spreadsheet ?	 
The Spreadsheet is created in such a way that it contains the
		Template Path in the First Column
		Default Names of Output File will be TemplateName_01.html and so on if the name of template is TemplateName
